This will be a device that will use servo motors to automatically feed 2 cats and then have a detection system in order to prevent each cat from eating each others food. I made this because sometimes we forget to feed the cats for a while and then they are hungry for a long time or we don't feed them early enough in the morning and they wake us up to do so.
