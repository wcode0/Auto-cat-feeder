## 10/20/2025 - I wrote code  

I found some code online and modified it to fit what I was doing. I have a lot of files of my cat uploaded to a vscode project then it takes the webcam and observers which cat is which I'm going to connect this to an esp32 which will run servo motors to decide which cat to let to each dish.![image.png](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6MzkxMiwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--8e58e4c1cd2aba202e15a8ae7f1a87ec5bab3453/image.png)

I added all the features I want this to have which is an esp32 with 3 servo motors and a speaker to make a noise whenever it is going to dispense food. It will use a micro usb to allow me to upload the code.
  

## 10/27/2025 9 PM - Routed the pcb  

first time doing it so it looks a tad bit messy but it should get the job done. I added holes it is a 2 layer pcb that stays under the 100mm by 100mm limit so overall I think it is good. I have footprints for 0805 package parts that I'm planning to place myself to reduce costs and so I have some experience doing that.![image](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6NjEwMCwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--e0fffddf280286c6a884426a7c798c19da42c5a8/image.png)

I enjoyed watching a 2 hour youtube playlist on how to use freecad and it is still is really complicated I'm hoping to understand soon . I have not gotten anything for the 3d model but instead just learnt freecad  

## 11/2/2025 - made the bom.csv  

 First time making a bom.csv. I need to take a break from freecad so i decided to make the bom.csv. in total it is around 41 $.![image](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6NzgxNCwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--b55c5ba2ad3dcec85b181a49c862cc1d4450cf07/image.png) I also spent 20 minutes trying to automate the urls by using the part number and the manufacturer part number when i could have just done it in 5 minutes manually
  

## 11/5/2025 - 3d model  

turns out freecad is hard. i went to tinkercad and decided that ill learn freecad another time anyway the 3d model is almost done so i should be good to ship![Screenshot from 2025-11-05 19-44-56](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6ODc2MywicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--b1b22a3e31e246c1d53db641351204e7ffc2e3d2/Screenshot%20from%202025-11-05%2019-44-56.png)
