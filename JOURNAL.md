## 10/20/2025 - I wrote code  

I found some code online and modified it to fit what I was doing. I have a lot of files of my cat uploaded to a vscode project then it takes the webcam and observers which cat is which I'm going to connect this to an esp32 which will run servo motors to decide which cat to let to each dish.![image.png](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6MzkxMiwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--8e58e4c1cd2aba202e15a8ae7f1a87ec5bab3453/image.png)
